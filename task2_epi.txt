a) The context-free grammar generates words that consist of variables (V), which can be any lowercase letter from a to z,
   and operators (O), which can be +, -, *, or /. These variables and operators are combined using parentheses (T).
   Specifically, the grammar generates words by either replacing the start symbol T with a variable (V),
   or by replacing T with an opening parenthesis followed by a combination of a T, an operator (O), and another T, followed by a closing parenthesis.

b) The word "(a + ((x - z) / y))" can be generated by the context-free grammar. One possible order of derivation rules to create this word is as follows:

    T -> (TOT)
    T -> V
    O -> +
    T -> (TOT)
    T -> (TOT)
    T -> V
    O -> -
    T -> V
    O -> /
    T -> V

The word "((p) + (o))" can also be generated by the context-free grammar. One possible order of derivation rules to create this word is as follows:

    T -> (TOT)
    T -> V
    O -> +
    T -> (TOT)
    T -> V
